                    <p>Hibiscus tea is an herbal tea made from the calyces of the Hibiscus sabdariffa plant, native to tropical climates in Africa. The dried calyces produce a naturally caffeine-free, vibrant red infusion with a fruity flavor and sweet-tart notes. Hibiscus can be enjoyed both hot and cold, and its rich taste often makes it a popular ingredient in herbal blends.</p>
