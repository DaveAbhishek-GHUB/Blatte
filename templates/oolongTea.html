                    <p>Tie Guan Yin refers to both a specific variety of the Camellia sinensis tea plant and the Chinese Oolong tea made from it. Originally, this tea variety comes from the Anxi region in the renowned tea province of Fujian. However, it's increasingly being grown in Taiwan as well. This floral Oolong variety is one of the most popular teas in China.</p>
